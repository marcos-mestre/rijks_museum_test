Feature: Collection API

  GET /api/[culture]/collection gives access to the collection with brief information about each object. The results are
  split up in result pages. By using the p and ps parameters you can fetch more results, up to a total of 10,000. All of
  the other parameters are identical to the advanced search page on the Rijksmuseum website. You can use that page to
  find out whatâ€™s the best query to use.

  Scenario: requesting the collection using a specific involvedMaker will return objects only from the chosen agent
    Given I send a Collection request with the involvedMaker Rembrandt+van+Rijn
    Then all the artObjects received in the Collection Response must be made by "Rembrandt van Rijn"
